# Predictive Modeling for Used Car Prices

This project aims to predict the prices of used cars using machine learning techniques based on various car attributes. Python, along with popular data science libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, was utilized for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and optimization.

## Project Overview

The dataset used for this project was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository ([dataset link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data)). The main objectives of the project were as follows:

1. **Data Importation and Preprocessing:**
   - Imported the dataset and performed data cleaning, handling missing values, and preprocessing to prepare it for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted comprehensive EDA to understand relationships between variables, visualize data distributions, and identify patterns or correlations.

3. **Modeling and Optimization:**
   - Implemented various supervised learning regression algorithms from Scikit-learn to predict used car prices.
   - Optimized models by selecting suitable features, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating performance metrics.
